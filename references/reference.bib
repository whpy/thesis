    abstract = "{Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.}",

abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different "thinned" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

    abstract = { We consider the dynamics of a low-dimensional model for turbulent shear flows. The model is based on Fourier modes and describes sinusoidal shear flow, in which fluid between two free-slip walls experiences a sinusoidal body force. The model contains nine modes, most of which have a direct hydrodynamical interpretation. We analyze the stationary states and periodic orbits for the model for two different domain sizes. Several kinds of bifurcations are identified, including saddle-node bifurcations, a period doubling cascade, and Hopf bifurcations of the periodic orbits. For both domain sizes, long-lived transient chaos appears to be associated with the presence of a large number of unstable periodic orbits. For the smaller minimal flow unit domain, it is found that a periodic solution is stable over a range of Reynolds numbers, and its bifurcations lead to the existence of a chaotic attractor. The model illustrates many phenomena observed and speculated to exist in the transition to turbulence in linearly stable shear flows. }

abstract = {Metastability occurs whenever, under given external conditions (as defined by the Reynolds number in hydrodynamics) more than one linearly stable solution may exist. In variational problems, the preferred state is usually claimed to be the one with the lowest energy. But in hydrodynamics, and except for very special conditions no energy functional exists. From an analogy between amplitude and reaction diffusion equations it is argued that the border separating in space two possible solutions of the flow equations (as turbulent and laminar in pipe flows or boundary layers) moves with a constant mean velocity, depending on the control parameter. The sign of this velocity allows to decide which state is stable and which is metastable. Possible physical implications of these ideas for various problems of hydrodynamics are discussed.}
